## Who am I?

My name is Mengqing Chen, though I often go by Joe. I hail from the scenic, rural region of southwest China, where I was born in 1997.

For the past two decades, I, like many Chinese students, dedicated myself to the rigors of education. My journey culminated in the Gaokao, a monumental college entrance examination that shaped the trajectory of my life.

My passion for reading once fueled a dream of becoming a writer, an aspiration I held dear. However, life took an unexpected turn, and I found myself on a different path as a software engineer. There’s a rich story behind this transition, one filled with twists and turns. Yet, I remain fortunate—my professional endeavors align closely with my interests and passions.

I carry with me a desire to write; it’s a thread that weaves through my experiences. That’s why I created this blog—an outlet for my thoughts and reflections. I hope you discover something here that resonates with you, something enlightening or intriguing.

## What is this blog?

This blog serves as a platform primarily dedicated to the world of software development. Here, you'll find a collection of posts that delve into various topics within this field, alongside insights into useful tools, valuable information, and personal experiences from my life.

As I look to the future, I may also explore writing more introspective pieces that reveal my innermost thoughts. While my prose may not possess the vividness of my earlier dreams as a writer, I am committed to conveying my genuine feelings and reflections with sincerity and authenticity.
