## Who am I?

Hey there! I'm Mengqing Chen. I grew up in a beautiful corner of southwest China, surrounded by mountains and valleys, and was born in '97.

For the past two decades, I, like many Chinese students, dedicated myself to the rigors of education. Then came the Gaokao - you know, that infamous Chinese college entrance exam that pretty much every Chinese student loses sleep over. It was like the academic Olympics, and that exam definitely changed the course of my life. Looking back now, I can laugh about those intense study sessions and the endless practice tests, but whew, what a ride that was!

You know what's funny? I used to be that kid who always had their nose in a book, dreaming of becoming the next great writer. Life had other plans though, and here I am, typing away code as a software engineer! It's been quite the plot twist, but honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way. I absolutely love what I do - it's like I stumbled into exactly where I needed to be.

The writing bug never really left me though (once a bookworm, always a bookworm, right?). That's actually why you're reading these words right now - I created this blog as my little corner of the internet to share my thoughts and maybe spark some interesting conversations. I hope you'll find something here that makes you think, smile, or nod in agreement.

## What is this blog?

Think of this space as my digital coffee shop where I mainly geek out about software development. You'll find me sharing all sorts of tech goodies - from cool coding tricks and helpful tools to "aha!" moments from my developer journey and life in general.

And hey, who knows? I might throw in some more personal stuff too - you know, those late-night thoughts and random musings that pop into your head. While I may not be the next Hemingway (yet!), I promise to keep it real and write from the heart. No filters, just genuine thoughts and honest experiences.
