# Pydantic

## Base Model

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = 'John Doe'
    age: int
```
The above code defines a base model with three attributes: id, name, and age. The id and age attributes are required, while the name attribute has a default value of John Doe.

Instantiating the model is as simple as passing in the required attributes:

```python

user = User(id=1, age=25)
```

## Optional

```python

from typing import Optional

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    age: Optional[int] = None
```

The code defines an optional age attribute. The attribute is optional because it has a default value of None.


## Nested Models

```python

from typing import List

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    age: int

class Post(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str
    content: str
    writer: User
```
The code defines a Post model with a writer attribute of type User. The writer attribute is a nested model.



## Validators

```python

from pydantic import BaseModel, validator, ValidationError

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    age: int

    @validator('age')
    def check_age(cls, v):
        if v < 18:
            raise ValidationError('must be 18 or older')
        return v
```

The code defines a validator for the age attribute. The validator checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If the age is less than 18, a ValidationError is raised.


## Field

```python

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int = Field(..., gt=0)
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=3, description='Name of the user')
    age: int = Field(None, gt=0, lt=150)
```

The Field class is very useful when you want to add metadata to your model attributes. `...` means required. `gt` means greater than. `lt` means less than. There are many other arguments you can pass to the Field class, such as `description`, `title`, `alias`, etc.
